# rash-drive-ML
This repo has all the files which I used for implementing learning based systems(currently classification) on my previous projects "rashDriveDetector" for making it highly relevant and useful(on an industrial scale).

Due to not-so-much amount of data, the algorithm showed an efficiency of 100% and was tested after changing random output values in the test set, which showed accuracy reduction to 93.4% telling that the algorithm was correctly implemented and is also working correctly- performing its task of prediction and anomaly exclusion.
